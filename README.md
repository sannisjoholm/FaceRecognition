# Face Recognition Project

This project contains folders for creating Face Recognition Scripts.

## Folder Structure
- **Training Folders**: The training folders are named after the Presidents of Finland. Each folder is expected to contain images of the respective individual.
- **Validation Folder**: Includes two pictures of Sauli Niinist√∂ for testing or validation purposes.
- **Output Folder**: Currently empty. This folder is intended to store the results of the face recognition process.

## Current Status
The project does not have a face recognition script yet.

## Next Steps
1. **Add a Face Recognition Script**:
   - Implement a script to:
     - Train a model using images in the training folders.
     - Validate the model with images in the validation folder.
     - Save results in the output folder.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Use libraries like `face_recognition`, `OpenCV`, or any other relevant tools for the script.

3. **Contribute**:
   - Contributions are welcome to build the face recognition script and improve the project structure.
